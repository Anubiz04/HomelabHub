# HomelabHub
Homelab Hub is a simple, locally hosted dashboard that allows you to add URLs to a database to make them organized and easily accessible.

# Introduction
Homelab Hub is a dashboard that I programmed because it bothered me that I always had to access services in my HomeLab by manually typing the IPs.
I hope that many more features will be implemented in the future.

# How it works
Homelab Hub is really easy to set up. You just have to set up a Webserver and a MySql Database in your local Network.
A good all in one solution would be using XAMPP if you happen to have a machine running that can support XAMPP.
If not you can easily install for example an Apache server and a mysql server on a Linux vm or container. 
The Webserver has to support PHP for it to work though.
